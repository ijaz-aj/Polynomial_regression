# Polynomial Regression with scikit-learn in Jupyter Notebook

## Overview:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn. Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable `X` and the dependent variable `y` is modeled as an `nth` degree polynomial.

## Project Files:
- **`polynomial_regression.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn.
- **`LICENSE`**: Choose an appropriate license for your project.
- **`README.md`**: The file you're currently reading.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/polynomial-regression.git
    cd polynomial-regression
    ```

## Usage:
1. Open the `polynomial_regression.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to understand and run the Polynomial Regression implementation.
3. Customize the notebook with your own dataset or parameters as needed.

## Results:
The notebook provides visualizations and insights into how Polynomial Regression fits the data. You can modify the degree of the polynomial and other parameters to experiment with different models.
